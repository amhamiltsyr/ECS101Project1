# M013-Group7.ECS101Project1

first project for ECS 101. Encodes a piece of text into binary and then decodes it into text again.

Instructions:

Code Program - File is hard coded in. Enter text you want to use into code_input.txt. Answer will be inputed into decode_input.txt

Decode Program - User will be prompted for file names in console. Enter decode_input.txt for the file to read in. The input file should have binary code in D.B format with D being the number of digits and B being the binary number. Enter decode_output.txt for the file to print to. 

This will make the two programs a full loop, making the final output the same as initial input.
